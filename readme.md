TODO
====

- [ ] Support more formatting directives
- [ ] Support a directive to explicitly clear whitespace
- [ ] Document pattern for passing children to tplfn
- [ ] `child!` should support inline `tpl!` style
- [ ] Support methods in addition to functions in `tplfn`
- [ ] Support `async`/`await` functions (needs anything special?)
- [ ] Support blocks inside string literals (maybe?)
